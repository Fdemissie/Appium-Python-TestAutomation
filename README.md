## Appium-Python-TestAutomation
This is simple python(unittest) based UI test automation quick starter using appium webdriver. Few sample test cases are included to showcase positive and negative test scenarios. Make sure to update capabilities inside base.py to match your test device and also make sure to change the sample URLs used inside the test files.


 ```
 capabilities = {
            'platformName': 'Android',
            'platformVersion': '10.0',
            'deviceName': 'Pixel 3 API 29',
            'automationName': 'UIAutomator2',
            'browserName': 'Chrome'
        }
